# SRM Yearbook

This is a php based **CRUD (Create-read-update-delete)** web application which acts as a virtual yearbook. 
(Because who wouldnt want to preserve their college personas for their future selves to cringe at  :flushed:)


## Technologies

We have a simple but robust **MYSQL** database accessed using **PHP PDO** libraries with *model-view-controller* format php code for the individual pages and a some bits of data validation, form validation using **Javascript** functions and session validations. P.S (we do divulge in cookie business :cookie: )

P.P.S Not too heavy on the styling with only some minimalistic CSS with table and form styling.

## How to use

 1. Run database.sql in your MYSQL Admin
 2. Go ahead and open your index.php file to launch the application
